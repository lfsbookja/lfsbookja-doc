          The original libraries were simply an archive of routines from
          which the required routines were extracted and linked into the
          executable program. These are described as static libraries, with
          names of the form <code class="filename">libfoo.a</code> on
          UNIX-like operating systems. On some old operating systems they are
          the only type available.
        </p>
        <p>
          On almost all Linux platforms there are also <span class=
          "quote">「<span class="quote">shared</span>」</span> (or equivalently
          <span class="quote">「<span class="quote">dynamic</span>」</span>)
          libraries (with names of the form <code class=
          "filename">libfoo.so</code>) – one copy of the library is loaded
          into virtual memory, and shared by all the programs which call any
          of its functions. This is space efficient.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the past, essential programs such as a shell were often linked
          statically so that some form of minimal recovery system would exist
          even if shared libraries, such as <code class=
          "filename">libc.so</code>, became damaged (e.g. moved to
          <code class="filename">lost+found</code> after <span class=
          "command"><strong>fsck</strong></span> following an unclean
          shutdown). Nowadays, most people use an alternative system install
          or a USB stick if they have to recover. Journaling filesystems also
          reduce the likelihood of this sort of problem.
        </p>
        <p>
          Within the book, there are various places where configure switches
          such as <em class="parameter"><code>--disable-static</code></em>
          are employed, and other places where the possibility of using
          system versions of libraries instead of the versions included
          within another package is discussed. The main reason for this is to
          simplify updates of libraries.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a package is linked to a dynamic library, updating to a newer
          library version is automatic once the newer library is installed
          and the program is (re)started (provided the library major version
          is unchanged, e.g. going from <code class=
          "filename">libfoo.so.2.0</code> to <code class=
          "filename">libfoo.so.2.1</code>. Going to <code class=
          "filename">libfoo.so.3</code> will require recompilation –
          <span class="command"><strong>ldd</strong></span> can be used to
          find which programs use the old version). If a program is linked to
          a static library, the program always has to be recompiled. If you
          know which programs are linked to a particular static library, this
          is merely an annoyance. But usually you will <span class=
          "emphasis"><em>not</em></span> know which programs to recompile.
        </p>
        <p>
          One way to identify when a static library is used, is to deal with
          it at the end of the installation of every package. Write a script
          to find all the static libraries in <code class=
          "filename">/usr/lib</code> or wherever you are installing to, and
          either move them to another directory so that they are no longer
          found by the linker, or rename them so that <code class=
          "filename">libfoo.a</code> becomes e.g. <code class=
          "filename">libfoo.a.hidden</code>. The static library can then be
          temporarily restored if it is ever needed, and the package needing
          it can be identified. This shouldn't be done blindly since many
          libraries only exist in a static version. For example, some
          libraries from the <span class="application">glibc</span> and
          <span class="application">gcc</span> packages should always be
          present on the system (<code class="filename">libc_nonshared.a,
          libg.a, libpthread_nonshared.a, libssp_nonshared.a,
          libsupc++.a</code> as of glibc-2.36 and gcc-12.2).
        </p>
        <p>
          If you use this approach, you may discover that more packages than
          you were expecting use a static library. That was the case with
          <span class="application">nettle-2.4</span> in its default
          static-only configuration: It was required by <span class=
          "application">GnuTLS-3.0.19</span>, but also linked into package(s)
          which used <span class="application">GnuTLS</span>, such as
          <span class="application">glib-networking-2.32.3</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many packages put some of their common functions into a static
          library which is only used by the programs within the package and,
          crucially, the library is <span class=
          "emphasis"><em>not</em></span> installed as a standalone library.
          These internal libraries are not a problem – if the package has to
          be rebuilt to fix a bug or vulnerability, nothing else is linked to
          them.
        </p>
        <p>
          When BLFS mentions system libraries, it means shared versions of
          libraries. Some packages such as <a class="xref" href=
          "../xsoft/firefox.html" title=
          "Firefox-115.6.0esr">Firefox-115.6.0</a> and <a class="xref" href=
          "../pst/gs.html" title=
          "ghostscript-10.02.1">ghostscript-10.02.1</a> bundle many other
          libraries in their build tree. The version they ship is often older
          than the version used in the system, so it may contain bugs –
          sometimes developers go to the trouble of fixing bugs in their
          included libraries, other times they do not.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes, deciding to use system libraries is an easy decision.
          Other times it may require you to alter the system version (e.g.
          for <a class="xref" href="../general/libpng.html" title=
          "libpng-1.6.40">libpng-1.6.40</a> if used for <a class="xref" href=
          "../xsoft/firefox.html" title=
          "Firefox-115.6.0esr">Firefox-115.6.0</a>). Occasionally, a package
          ships an old library and can no longer link to the current version,
          but can link to an older version. In this case, BLFS will usually
          just use the shipped version. Sometimes the included library is no
          longer developed separately, or its upstream is now the same as the
          package's upstream and you have no other packages which will use
          it. In those cases, you'll be lead to use the included library even
          if you usually prefer to use system libraries.
