        To avoid situations like this (i.e., your database server software
        refuses to start), read the following discussion of the best way to
        upgrade a DBMS (Database Management System).
      </p>
      <p>
        The root cause of the error shown above was an upgrade of the server
        software to a newer major version which left the data files
        untouched. In this case, the administrator was able to recover the
        DBMS without any loss of data.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even if you are doing an initial DBMS install, read through this
        section. It provides information about implementing backup and
        restore procedures (or at least a strategy for creating them) which
        will satisfy your needs and guarantee the safety of your data.
      </p>
      <div class="sect2" lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">
        <h2 class="sect2">
          Upgrade Database Server Packages
        </h2>
        <p>
          Database systems work on files which hold the database metadata and
          the data itself. The internal structure of these files is optimized
          for use by the server software. When such server software is
          upgraded, the new software may utilize a different file format than
          had previously been used. Sometimes the new software can work with
          the old format as well as the new one—but without the performance
          improvements the new format provides. Other times, the new server
          software will reformat the data files automatically after the
          upgrade.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, the most likely case is that the new server software
          complains about out of date file formats and exits. When this
          happens, and you have overwritten the old server software, you may
          end up with a broken system and lost data.
        </p>
        <p>
          Changes in data file formats usually happen at major version
          changes, but they can also occur at other times. Before upgrading
          any DBMS software, check the documentation to see if this upgrade
          makes changes which require reformatting the database.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, if you have databases with content that is not easily
          rebuilt, it is always a good idea to create backups of the database
          from time to time. Before upgrading the server software, you should
          run another backup.

              A backup is useless if there is no verified process to restore
              the data from this backup. When running a database server, you
              should not only create backups; you should also verify that the
              restore process really works. The time to test the restore
              procedure is <span class="emphasis"><em>before</em></span> you
              urgently need to recover lost data.
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            Most database server software provides some basic tools to create
            backups of your data. Usually the backups created with those
            tools can be read by newer versions of the software (via a
            restore tool). Using older restore tools with newer backup data
            is a bad idea; you should <span class=
            "emphasis"><em>never</em></span> blindly assume that it will
            work. It might, but usually it doesn't.
          </p>
          <p>
            The easiest way to upgrade your database files is to
          </p>
          <div class="itemizedlist">
            <ul>
              <li class="listitem">
                <p>
                  Create a full database backup using the old tools.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This step creates an offline copy of the database files—for
                  long term archiving, for disaster recovery, or as
                  preparation for an upgrade. This offline backup consists of
                  either (1) a full one-to-one copy of the current database
                  files, or (2) a full backup of the database files from a
                  certain point in time, plus all the journal data (that is
                  Oracle® terminology, it is called "Continuous Archiving" or
                  "write ahead log (WAL)" in Postgresql) describing the
                  changes made after that point in time. This second form
                  takes less time to create (if the DB software provides this
                  type of journaling) because you only have to save the data
                  that have changed since the last full backup was created.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When upgrading database server software, a full backup
                  (which can be used for subsequent incremental backups)
                  should be created; but if there is a lot of data, an
                  incremental backup will suffice. The best strategy for you
                  depends on the amount of data stored in your database (is
                  it a few hundred table rows, or is it hundreds of
                  terabytes?). A full backup in the latter case can't be done
                  quickly. To fully protect your data, create a backup of the
                  old programs (and/or their sources) and save it, along with
                  the data files, to be certain there is a fallback solution
                  if the new software cannot read the old data.

                <p>
                  In this step, instructions to build the database server
                  software are executed just as they are shown in subsequent
                  sections talking about the DBMs like MariaDB or Postgresql.
                  That is, build the software as usual using BLFS
                  instructions.

                </p>
                <p>
                  To restore the data, the tools of the newly installed
                  server software should be used. During the restoration
                  process, the new tools will create and/or upgrade the data
                  files in the format the new software requires. It is
                  assumed that newer software is capable of reading old data.

          <p>
            Since you already have a backup procedure in place (and you have
            tested your restore procedure, right?), this might be the easiest
            way to upgrade as you can use your well known processes to
            upgrade just as you always do—at least in terms of the backup and
            restore.

          </h4>
          <p>
            Some database systems (for instance Postgresql) provide a tool
            which can reformat (upgrade) the existing database files to the
            new format. If you need to restore from a backup (for example,
            running the upgrade tool failed) you will have to reinstall the
            old software to recover your data.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even though the reformatting tools might work as advertised, you
            should create a full backup before running them. A failure could
            cause serious damage to the database.

            Do not underestimate <span class="application">Sqlite</span>. It
            is a feature-rich DBMS. The main difference from the two big
            players above is that Sqlite does not provide access via a
            network API. Sqlite databases are always stored on the machine
            running the program which uses the database. The manipulation of
            data content is done via API calls to library functions directly
            within the program.
