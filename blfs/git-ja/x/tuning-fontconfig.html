        <p>
          If you only read text in English, and are happy with the common
          libre fonts listed on the next page, you may never need to worry
          about the details of how <span class=
          "application">Fontconfig</span> works. But there are many things
          which can be altered if they do not suit your needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although this page is long, it barely scratches the surface and you
          will be able to find many alternative views on the web (but please
          remember that some things have changed over the years, for example
          the autohinter is no longer the default). The aim here is to give
          you enough information to understand the changes you are making,
          why they may not always work, and to identify online information
          which is no-longer appropriate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, some of the terminology is ambiguous (e.g. 'font
          face' can mean a name known to Fontconfig, <span class=
          "emphasis"><em>or</em></span> the ordinary, condensed, etc
          variations of a font) and 'style' can be used to differentiate
          'ordinary' from 'italic', or in describing some classes of Serif
          fonts.

          Protocol
        </h2>
        <p>
          The Xft font protocol provides antialiased font rendering through
          <span class="application">freetype</span>, and fonts are controlled
          from the client side using <span class=
          "application">Fontconfig</span> (except for <a class="xref" href=
          "../xsoft/rxvt-unicode.html" title=
          "rxvt-unicode-9.31">rxvt-unicode-9.31</a> which can use fonts
          listed in <code class="filename">~/.Xresources</code>, and
          <a class="xref" href="../xsoft/AbiWord.html" title=
          "AbiWord-3.0.5">AbiWord-3.0.5</a> which only uses the specified
          font). The default search path is <code class=
          "filename">/usr/share/fonts</code> and <code class=
          "filename">~/.local/share/fonts</code>, although for the moment the
          old and deprecated location <code class="filename">~/.fonts</code>
          still works. <span class="application">Fontconfig</span> searches
          directories in its path recursively and maintains a cache of the
          font characteristics in each directory. If the cache appears to be
          out of date, it is ignored, and information is fetched from the
          fonts themselves (that can take a few seconds if you have a lot of
          fonts installed).
        </p>
        <p>
          If you've installed <span class="application">Xorg</span> in any
          prefix other than <code class="filename">/usr</code>, any
          <span class="application">X</span> fonts were not installed in a
          location known to <span class="application">Fontconfig</span>.
          Symlinks were created from the <code class="filename">OTF</code>
          and <code class="filename">TTF</code> <span class=
          "application">X</span> font directories to <code class=
          "filename">/usr/share/fonts/X11-{OTF,TTF}</code> in Xorg Fonts.
          This allows <span class="application">Fontconfig</span> to use the
          OpenType and TrueType fonts provided by <span class=
          "application">X</span>, although many people will prefer to use
          more modern fonts.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="application">Fontconfig</span> uses names to define
          fonts. Applications generally use generic font names such as
          "Monospace", "Sans" and "Serif". <span class=
          "application">Fontconfig</span> resolves these names to a font that
          has all characters that cover the orthography of the language
          indicated by the locale settings.

          <a id="useful-commands" name="useful-commands"></a>Useful Commands
        </h2>
        <p>
          The following commands may be helpful when working with
          <span class="application">Fontconfig</span>, particularly if you
          are interested in overriding which font will be chosen.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="command"><strong>fc-list | less</strong></span> :
          shows a list of all available fonts (/path/to/filename: Font
          Name:style). If you installed a font and it doesn't show, then the
          directory it is contained in is not readable by your user.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="command"><strong>fc-match 'Font Name'</strong></span>
          : tells you which font will be used if the named font is requested.
          Typically you would use this to see what happens if a font you have
          not installed is requested, but you can also use it if the system
          is giving you a different font from what you expected (perhaps
          because <span class="application">Fontconfig</span> does not think
          that the font supports your language).
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="command"><strong>fc-match <em class=
          "replaceable"><code>TYPE</code></em></strong></span> : shows which
          font will be used in the current language for that <em class=
          "replaceable"><code>TYPE</code></em> (Monospace, Sans, Serif
          <span class="emphasis"><em>(initial capital letter is
          optional)</em></span>). If that font does not map a codepoint,
          <span class="application">Fontconfig</span> can take a glyph from
          any available font, even if it is not of the specified type. Any
          other value for <em class="replaceable"><code>TYPE</code></em> will
          be assumed to be Sans.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="command"><strong>fc-match 'Serif
          :lang=ja:weight=bold'</strong></span> will tell you which font and
          weight will be chosen for Japanese text in bold weight. It does not
          mean that the reported font will necessarily be able to show
          Japanese ideograms, so a fallback might be used, or some glyphs may
          be missing. For language codes, use ISO-639 values such as 'fr',
          'ja', 'zh-cn'. Note that an unrecognized value such as just 'zh'
          will not return any match. To illustrate the fallback, on a system
          where both Noto Sans Mono and DejaVu Sans Mono are installed,
          <span class="command"><strong>fc-match 'monospace
          :lang=en</strong></span> shows Noto Sans Mono will be used, but if
          the lang is changed to 'ar' (arabic) DejaVu Sans will be used.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want to determine if a font file has hinting (many older
          fonts do not, because it was patented) use <span class=
          "command"><strong>fc-query <em class=
          "replaceable"><code>/path/to/fontfile</code></em> | grep
          'fonthashint:'</strong></span>: which will report 'True(s)' or
          'False(s)'. Some recent fonts with both TTF and OTF versions will
          have hinting in the TTF files.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you wish to know which font will be used for a string of text
          (i.e. one or more glyphs, preceded by a space), paste the following
          command and replace the <code class="literal">xyz</code> by the
          text you care about:
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="command"><strong>FC_DEBUG=4 pango-view
          --font=monospace -t xyz | grep family</strong></span> : this
          requires <a class="xref" href="pango.html" title=
          "Pango-1.50.14">Pango-1.50.14</a> and <a class="xref" href=
          "../general/imagemagick.html" title=

          <a class="xref" href=

          tiny window, and after closing that the last line of the output
          will show which font was chosen. This is particularly useful for
          CJK languages, and you can also pass a language, e.g.
          PANGO_LANGUAGE=en;ja (English, then assume Japanese) or just zh-cn
          (or other variants such as zh-sg or zh-tw).

          You can also have a personal <code class=

          <code class="filename">~/.config/fontconfig/</code>).

          "rules-to-choose-a-font"></a>The rules to choose a font
        </h2>
        <p>
          If the requested font is installed, and provided it contains the
          codepoints <span class="emphasis"><em>required</em></span> for the
          current language (in the source, see the .orth files in the
          <code class="filename">fc-lang/</code> directory), it will be used.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, if the document or page requested a font which is not
          installed (or, occasionally, does not contain all the required
          codepoints) the following rules come into play: First, <code class=
          "filename">30-metric-aliases.conf</code> is used to map aliases for
          some fonts with the same metrics (same size, etc). Note that there
          are both weak and strong aliases so that aliases for one form such
          as Helvetica or Times New Roman can be satisfied by the other
          style, i.e. anything which is an alias of Arial or Times in those
          examples. some examples of Latin fonts with the same metrics can be
          found in the 'Substitutes' PDFs at <a class="ulink" href=
          "http://zarniwhoop.uk/files/PDF-substitutes/">zarniwhoop.uk.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          After that, an unknown font will be searched for in <code class=
          "filename">45-latin.conf</code>: 'Latin' covers Cyrillic and Greek,
          and now also maps system-ui fonts which are used for User Interface
          messages in other alphabets. If the font is found it will be mapped
          as serif, sans-serif, monospace, fantasy, cursive, or system-ui.
          Otherwise, 49-sansserif.conf will assume it is Sans.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then <code class="filename">60-latin.conf</code> provides ordered
          lists of the fallbacks - <a class="xref" href=
          "TTF-and-OTF-fonts.html#noto-fonts" title="Noto fonts">Noto
          fonts</a> will be used if you installed them. Cyrillic and Greek
          appear to be treated in the same way.All of these files prefer
          commercial fonts if they are present, although modern libre fonts
          are often at least equal. Finally, if a codepoint is still not
          found it can be taken from any available system font. The following
          details only mention freely available fonts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Default Persian fonts are dealt with in <code class=
          "filename">65-fonts-persian.conf</code>. It looks as if all the
          listed fonts are commercial. Using fonts that support Persian
          (which has its own variant of the arabic alphabet, and its own font
          styles) is outside the skills of the BLFS editors.
        </p>
        <p>
          All remaining scripts for which <span class=
          "application">Fontconfig</span> has preferences (CJK scripts, Indic
          scripts) are dealt with in <code class=
          "filename">65-nonlatin.conf</code>. These are again nominally
          grouped as Serif, Sans-Serif, Monospace. Of the free fonts,
          WenQuanYi Zen Hei (Pan-CJK Sans) comes first for both Serif and for
          Sans. Therefore, if you install this as a fallback but want to use
          different fonts for Japanese or Korean you will need to set up a
          preference. Similarly, the old fireflysung Serif font is also
          listed for Sans.
        </p>
        <p>
          After Pan-CJK and Chinese fonts come several Japanese fonts and
          then several Korean fonts (both split appropriately between Sans
          and Serif). Finally come the various Lohit Indic families (one font
          file per script), labelled as both Sans and Serif.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Monospace fonts listed in <code class=
          "filename">65-nonlatin.conf</code> do not include WenQuanYi Zen Hei
          although that will be available as a fallback if installed. Several
          Japanese Gothic fonts are listed, followed by AR PL KaitiM GB (a
          zh-sc 'Brush' font), AR PL Serif fonts for zh-sc (SungtiL) and
          zh-tw (Mingti2L), some Korean Sans fonts and the various Lohit
          Indic families.
        </p>
        <p>
          For UI fonts, various Noto Sans UI fonts are the only listed free
          fonts.
        </p>
        <p>
          The various Noto CJK fonts are <span class=
          "emphasis"><em>not</em></span> among the listed fonts, possibly the
          RedHat developers preferred other fonts. These now come in many
          variations, and most users who use these will not install any other
          CJK fonts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before Fontconfig-2.14, the first preferred Latin font family was
          Bitstream Vera. In practice that was rarely used because it covered
          so little. After that, DejaVu was the next preferred family, so
          people were recommended to install that. That has now changed,
          Bitstream Vera has been replaced by the relevant Noto fonts (Serif,
          Sans, Sans Mono), so these will be preferred if they have been
          installed, followed by DejaVu.
        </p>
        <p>
          For serif, Times New Roman could have been aliased from Liberation
          Serif or Tinos, and Times from TeX Gyre Termes, so although the
          named fonts are not free, the metric-compatible fonts can be used.
          Ignoring other non-free fonts, the remaining order for serif is:
          Times New Roman, Luxi Serif, Nimbus Roman No9 L, and Times. In
          practice, that means those fonts at the end of the list are
          unlikely to be used unless a web page asks for them.
        </p>
        <p>
          For sans-serif, the remaining order is anything mapped to Arial,
          Luxi Sans, Nimbus Sans L, and anything mapped to Helvetica.
        </p>
        <p>
          The remaining alternatives for monospace are Inconsolata, anything
          mapped to Courier New, Luxi Mono, Nimbus Mono, and anything mapped
          to Courier.
        </p>
        <p>
          For 'fantasy' there are no free fonts, so <span class=
          "application">Fontconfig</span> will fall back to sans-serif.
        </p>
        <p>
          For 'cursive', the only free font is TeX Gyre Chorus as an alias
          for ITC Zapf chancery, otherwise <span class=
          "application">Fontconfig</span> will again fall back to sans-serif.
        </p>
        <p>
          The system-ui category is unusual. It is for interface messages, so
          some scripts need special versions to fit in the available space.
          For Latin, Greek and Cyrillic an ordinary sans font should fit
          without problems. However, the first preferred font is Cantarell,
          followed by Noto Sans UI. Cantarell started as a Latin sans-serif
          font, that has been forked in Gnome under the same name but they
          only provide the source. The Noto Sans UI fonts are for other
          languages.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since Fontconfig-2.12.5, there is also generic family matching for
          some emoji and math fonts, please see {45,60}-generic.conf.
        </p>
        <p>

          It is possible to change how, or if, fonts are hinted. The
          following example file contains the default settings, but with
          comments. The settings are very much down to the user's preferences
          and to the choice of fonts, so a change which improves some pages
          may worsen others. The preferred location for this file is:
          <code class="filename">~/.config/fontconfig/fonts.conf</code>
        </p>
        <p>
          To try out different settings, you may need to exit from Xorg and
          then run <span class="command"><strong>startx</strong></span> again
          so that all applications use the new settings. Several things can
          override the fontconfig settings, see <a class="xref" href=

    hintfull: is supposed to give a crisp font that aligns well to the
    character-cell grid but at the cost of its proper shape. However, anything
    using Pango &gt;= 1.44 will not support full hinting, Pango now uses harfbuzz
    for hinting. Apps which use Skia (e.g. Chromium, Firefox) should not be
    affected by this. 

    hintmedium: is reported to be broken.
    hintslight is the default: - supposed to be more fuzzy but retains shape.

    hintnone: seems to turn hinting off.
    The variations are marginal and results vary with different fonts --&gt;
    &lt;edit mode="assign" name="hintstyle"&gt; &lt;const&gt;hintslight&lt;/const&gt;&lt;/edit&gt;

    &lt;!-- antialiasing is on by default and really helps for faint characters

          You will now need to edit the file in your preferred editor. Many

            Hinting, if enabled, is done in <span class=
            "application">FreeType</span>. Since FreeType-2.7 the default
            TrueType interpreter is v40. The original v35 hinter could be
            enabled by an environment variable, but is only really
            appropriate to original Microsoft TTF fonts (Arial, etc). The v38
            hinter (Infinality) is not built by default and all the options
            to tune it have been removed. For full details see <a class=

            Xorg assumes screens have 96 dots per inch (DPI). Most LCD
            screens are close to this, but some people detect colour fringing
            if their screen diverges from that size. See <a class="xref"
            href="tuning-fontconfig.html#calc-dpi" title=

          <p>
            If you have a High DPI screen (often described as '4K' or larger)
            you will probably use larger font sizes and benefit from
            disabling hinting.

                codepoints to character forms appropriate to Old Church
                Slavonic instead of the expected current shapes: fine if that
                is what you need, but painful for normal use.

                When a font is added to CTAN, it is accompanied by TeX
                packages to use it in the old engines (<span class=
                "application">xelatex</span> does not normally need this),
                and then the version is often frozen whilst the font is
                separately maintained. Some of these fonts such as <a class=

                "DejaVu fonts">Dejavu fonts</a> are probably already
                installed on your BLFS system in a newer version, and if you
                have multiple versions of a font it is unclear which one will

          of the Arkandis Open Type fonts available to other applications,
          and all three of the ParaType TrueType fonts. Adjust or repeat the
          lines as desired, to either make all the <code class=
          "filename">opentype/</code> or <code class=
          "filename">truetype</code>fonts available, or to select different
          font directories. As the <code class="systemitem">root</code> user:

          With the exception of web pages which use WOFF fonts and either
          supply them or link to google to download them, web pages have
          traditionally suggested a list of preferred font family names if
          they cared (e.g. Times New Roman, Serif). There are many reasons
          why people may wish to have pages which specify a preferred font
          use a different font, or prefer specific fonts in Monospace or Sans
          or Serif. As you will expect, there a number of different ways of
          achieving this.

          alternative approaches would be to specify a Chinese font ahead of
          the Japanese font, meaning that only Kana symbols will be used from

          Some fonts, particularly Chinese fonts, ship with conf files which
          can be installed in <code class=
          "filename">/etc/fonts/conf.d</code>. However, if you do that and
          then use a terminal to run any command which uses <span class=
          "application">Fontconfig</span> you may see error messages such as
          :
        </p>
        <p>
          <code class="literal">Fontconfig warning:
          "/etc/fonts/conf.d/69-odofonts.conf", line 14: Having multiple
          &lt;family&gt; in &lt;alias&gt; isn't supported and may not work as
          expected</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In practice, these old rules do not work. For non-CJK users,
          <span class="application">Fontconfig</span> will usually do a good
          job <span class="emphasis"><em>without</em></span> these rules.
          Their origin dates back to when CJK users needed handcrafted
          bitmaps to be legible at small sizes, and those looked ugly next to
          antialiased Latin glyphs - they preferred to use the same CJK font
          for the Latin glyphs. There is a side-effect of doing this : the
          (Serif) font is often also used for Sans, and in such a situation
          the (English) text in <span class="application">Gtk</span> menus
          will use this font - compared to system fonts, as well as being
          serif it is both faint and rather small. That can make it
          uncomfortable to read.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nevertheless, these old conf files can be fixed if you wish to use
          them. The following example is the first part of <code class=
          "filename">64-arphic-uming.conf</code> from <a class="xref" href=
          "TTF-and-OTF-fonts.html#UMing" title="UMing">UMing</a> - there are
          many more similar items which also need changing :
        </p>
        <pre class="root">
   &lt;match target="pattern"&gt;
       &lt;test qual="any" name="lang" compare="contains"&gt;
           &lt;string&gt;zh-cn&lt;/string&gt;
           &lt;string&gt;zh-sg&lt;/string&gt;
       &lt;/test&gt;
       &lt;test qual="any" name="family"&gt;
           &lt;string&gt;serif&lt;/string&gt;
       &lt;/test&gt;
       &lt;edit name="family" mode="prepend" binding="strong"&gt;
           &lt;string&gt;AR PL UMing CN&lt;/string&gt;
       &lt;/edit&gt;
   &lt;/match&gt;
</pre>
        <p>
          The process to correct this is straightforward but tedious - for
          every item which produces an error message, using your editor (as
          the <code class="systemitem">root</code> user), edit the installed
          file to repeat the whole block as many times as there are multiple
          variables, then reduce each example to have only one of them. You
          may wish to work on one error at a time, save the file after each
          fix, and from a separate term run a command such as <span class=
          "command"><strong>fc-list 2&gt;&amp;1 | less</strong></span> to see
          that the fix worked. For the block above, the fixed version will be
          :
        </p>
        <pre class="root">

          <a id="font-weights" name="font-weights"></a>About font weights
        </h2>
        <p>
          When this page and the next page were first created, Latin fonts
          came with a maximum of two weights - either Regular or Book (Book
          typically has a larger X-height to make it easier to read in large
          blocks of text), and Bold - and perhaps an Italic (or Slant) style.
          A few fonts also had Condensed faces (to fit more text into a line
          and usually only used when specified). Without CSS (Cascading Style
          Sheets) markup, text used the Regular or Book weight except when
          &lt;b&gt; ... &lt;/b&gt; markup was used for bold text. Italic
          styles would be invoked by &lt;i&gt; ... &lt;/i&gt; markup, along
          with the bold markup for Bold Italic.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some faces now contain up to 9 weights, possibly also with a
          variable font (to save space by including all the alternatives in
          one file and possibly allowing intermediate weights). For most
          desktop users who do not need this wide range of weights for
          creating content, it is simpler to only install one or two weights.
          If a face has individual weights plus a variable font, the variable
          font is usually in the top level of the supplied directory, with
          individual weights in a <code class="filename">static/</code>
          subdirectory. Except when initially reviewing a font, it makes no
          sense to install both static and variable, nor all the possible
          weights.
        </p>
        <p>
          The weights are labelled from 100 (Thin) to 900 (Black or Heavy) in
          CSS terminology, with 400 being normal and 700 bold. The full set
          of weights is described at <a class="xref" href=
          "tuning-fontconfig.html#css-weights" title=
          "Table of CSS font weights">Table of CSS font weights</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have installed a font with a range of weights, you can copy
          <a class="ulink" href=
          "https://linuxfromscratch.org/~ken/font-weights.html">font-weights.html</a>
          to your local machine. As shipped it will use your default Serif
          font assuming you have one. Edit it to point to a specific
          installed font using the name known to <span class=
          "application">Fontconfig</span> (also in the *EDITME FONTNAME* text
          items) and open it from your desktop browser. You can also use it
          to look at a font with only two installed weights, e.g. for testing
          to see if you prefer other weights.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite the details in that Mozilla link, it appears that if only
          normal and bold weights are installed, SemiBold (600) will be shown
          using bold.
        </p>
        <p>
          There seems to be a little scope for changing which weights are
          used for normal and bold <span class="emphasis"><em>if only two
          weights have been installed</em></span>. Firefox, and probably
          other browsers, will look for the next weight heavier than normal.
          If that is less than bold (Medium, maybe SemiBold - uncertain) it
          will be used for normal and then the next higher weight, if any
          will be used for bold, allowing you to make the fonts slightly
          darker. Conversely, if only a weight less than normal has been
          installed, such as Light, that will be used for both normal and
          bold weights (the upward search happens first).
        </p>
        <p>
          If you remove some weights of a system font, you may need to run
          <span class="command"><strong>fc-cache</strong></span> as the
          <code class="systemitem">root</code> user and then log out
          completely to clear caches associated with your user.
