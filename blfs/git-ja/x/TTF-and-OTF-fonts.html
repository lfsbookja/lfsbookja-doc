          About TTF and OTF fonts
        </h2>
        <p>
          Originally, Xorg provided only bitmap fonts. Later, some scalable
          Type1 fonts were added, but the desktop world moved on to using
          TrueType and Open Type fonts. To support these, Xorg uses Xft, the
          X FreeType interface library, with <span class=
          "application">Fontconfig</span> (see previous page for details
          including how fonts are selected and various reasons why a font
          might be ignored).
        </p>
        <p>
          A few fonts are provided as collections (TTC or OTC) where font
          data is shared between different fonts, which saves disk space.
          These should be treated in exactly the same way as individual TTF
          or OTF files.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a font provides both TTF and OTF forms, you should prefer the
          OTF form in Linux, as it may provide more features for programs
          which know how to use them (such as xelatex). The TTF files of
          these fonts usually contain hinting, see <a class="xref" href=
          "tuning-fontconfig.html#hinting-and-antialiasing" title=
          "Hinting and Anti-aliasing">Hinting and Anti-aliasing</a> and
          <a class="xref" href=
          "tuning-fontconfig.html#items-which-can-override-fontconfig" title=
          "Items which can override Fontconfig">Items which can override
          Fontconfig</a> for reasons why hinting may be undesirable or
          unusable.
        </p>
        <p>
          A font may have multiple variations. For example, Noto Sans has 9
          weights (ExtraLight, Light, Thin, Normal, Medium, SemiBold, Bold,
          ExtraBold, and Black) and 2 styles (Regular and Italic), thus 18
          variations in total. Normally each variation is provided as a
          separate TTF or OTF file. For full coverage you need to install all
          these TTF or OTF files. Even if you are low on disk space, you
          should still install two weights (Regular and Bold) by two styles
          (Normal and Italic) if the font has these variations. Some fonts do
          not have Italic style (for example most CJK fonts and some
          monospace fonts), and some fonts only have one variation (for
          example Noto Sans Math, it only provides the glyph of some
          mathematic symbols).
        </p>
        <p>
          Some fonts are also available as <span class=
          "emphasis"><em>variable</em></span> font files. Unlike a normal
          font file which only contains one variation, a variable font file
          contains infinite variations. Each variation can be defined by the
          application using this font by assigning number(s) to one or more
          variables. There are also pre-defined <span class=
          "emphasis"><em>named instances</em></span> analogous to the
          traditional variations. For example, with the variable version of
          Noto Sans, the weight variable can be assigned any number not less
          than 100 and not greater than 900, and 9 named instances are
          pre-defined: ExtraLight for weight=100, Regular for weight=400,
          Bold for weight=700, etc. So once a variable font file for Noto
          Sans is installed, all the 9 named instances (or <span class=
          "quote">「<span class="quote">variations</span>」</span>) are
          available. Note that the slope is not defined as a variable in the
          variable version of Noto Sans, so Regular and Italic are still
          traditional variations and a separate variable font file is needed
          for the Italic variation.
        </p>
        <p>
          A variable font file is obviously more flexible than the normal
          (static) font files. It's extremely useful for fine tuning the font
          for Web pages or publications. And, the size of a variable font
          file is usually significantly smaller than the total size of
          several static font files for multiple variations. For example, the
          variable font file for Noto Sans SC is only 11M, while the total
          size of 9 static font files for Noto Sans SC is 91M. But you must
          make sure your applications really support variable fonts before
          installing one. For example, <span class=
          "command"><strong>lualatex</strong></span> supports variable font
          but <span class="command"><strong>xelatex</strong></span> does not.
          So if you want to use a font for an article and use <span class=
          "command"><strong>xelatex</strong></span> for typesetting, you must
          not install the variable font files.
        </p>
        <p>
          For information about variable fonts, please see <a class="ulink"
          href=
          "https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/introducing_type/introducing_variable_fonts/">
          Variable Fonts</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          For some scripts, <span class="application">Pango</span> is
          required to render things correctly, either by selecting different
          glyph forms, or by combining glyphs - in both cases, according to
          the context. This applies particularly to Arabic and Indic scripts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Standard scalable fonts that come with <span class=
          "application">X</span> provide very poor Unicode coverage. You may
          notice in applications that use <span class=
          "application">Xft</span> that some characters appear as a box with
          four binary digits inside. In this case, a font with the required
          glyphs has not been found. Other times, applications that don't use
          other font families by default and don't accept substitutions from
          <span class="application">Fontconfig</span> will display blank
          lines when the default font doesn't cover the orthography of the
          user's language.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fonts available to a program are those which were present when
          it was started, so if you add an extra font and wish to use it in a
          program which is currently running, then you will have to close and
          restart that program.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some people are happy to have dozens, or even hundreds, of font
          files available, but if you ever wish to select a specific font in
          a desktop application (for example in a word processor) then
          scrolling through a lot of fonts to find the right one is slow and
          awkward - fewer is better. So, for some font packages you might
          decide to install only one of the fonts - but nevertheless install
          the different variants (italic, bold, etc) as these are all
          variations for the same font name.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the past, everybody recommended running <span class=
          "command"><strong>fc-cache</strong></span> as the <code class=
          "systemitem">root</code> user after installing or removing fonts,
          but this is not necessary anymore on Linux, <span class=
          "application">Fontconfig</span> will do it automatically if needed
          as well as if the font caches are more than 30 seconds old.
          However, if you add a font and want to use it immediately, you can
          run that command as a normal user.
        </p>

          There are several references below to CJK characters. This stands
          for Chinese, Japanese and Korean, although modern Korean is now
          almost all written using the phonetic Hangul glyphs (it used to
          sometimes use Hanja glyphs which are similar to Chinese and
          Japanese). Unicode decided to go for <a class="ulink" href=
          "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_unification">Han Unification</a>
          and to map some Chinese and Japanese glyphs to the same codepoints.
          This was very unpopular in Japan, and the result is that different
          fonts will render some codepoints in quite different shapes. In
          addition, Simplified Chinese will sometimes use the same codepoint
          as Traditional Chinese but will show it differently, somewhat
          analogous to the different shapes used for the letters 'a' and 'g'
          in English (single-storey and two-storey), except that in a
          language context one will look "wrong" rather than just
          "different".
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike most other packages in this book, the BLFS editors do not
          monitor the versions of the fonts on this page - once a font is
          good enough for general use, the typical additions in a new version
          are minor (e.g. new currency symbols, or glyphs not for a modern
          language, such as emojis or playing cards). Therefore, none of
          these fonts show version or md5 information.
        </p>
        <p>
          The list below will not provide complete Unicode coverage. Unicode
          is updated every year, and most additions are now for historic
          writing systems. For almost-complete coverage you can install the
          full set of <a class="xref" href=
          "TTF-and-OTF-fonts.html#noto-fonts" title="Noto fonts">Noto
          fonts</a> (there are separate fonts for different writing systems).
          We used to recommend the <a class="ulink" href=
          "https://unifont.org/fontguide/">Unicode Font Guide</a>, but that
          has not been updated since 2008 and many of its links are dead.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rendered examples of most of these fonts, and many others, with
          details of what languages they cover, can be found at a <a class=
          "ulink" href=
          "http://zarniwhoop.uk/ttf-otf-notes.html">font-comparison</a>

        <p>
          Fonts are often supplied in zip files, requiring <a class="xref"
          href="../general/unzip.html" title="UnZip-6.0">UnZip-6.0</a> to
          list and extract them, but even if the current release is a
          tarball, you should still check to see if it will create a
          directory (scattering the contents of a zipfile or tarball across
          the current directory can be very messy, and a few fonts create
          __MACOSX/ directories). In addition, many fonts are supplied with
          permissions which do not let 'other' users read them - if a font is
          to be installed for system-wide use, any directories must be mode
          755 and all the files mode 644, so you need to change them if the
          permissions are different. If you forget, the root user may be able
          to see a particular font in <span class=
          "command"><strong>fc-list</strong></span>, but a normal user will
          not be able to use them.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a font installation example, consider the installation of the
          <a class="xref" href="TTF-and-OTF-fonts.html#dejavu-fonts" title=
          "DejaVu fonts">Dejavu fonts</a>. In this particular package, the
          TTF files are in a subdirectory. From the unpacked source
          directory, run the following commands as the <code class=
          "systemitem">root</code> user:
        </p>
        <pre class="root"><kbd class=
        "command">install -v -d -m755 /usr/share/fonts/dejavu &amp;&amp;
install -v -m644 ttf/*.ttf /usr/share/fonts/dejavu &amp;&amp;
fc-cache -v /usr/share/fonts/dejavu</kbd></pre>
        <p>
          If you wish, you can also install any licenses or other
          documentation, either alongside the font or in a corresponding
          directory under <code class="filename">/usr/share/doc/</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          A few fonts ship with source as well as the completed TTF or OTF
          file(s). Unless you intend to modify the font, and have the correct
          tools (sometimes <a class="xref" href="../xsoft/fontforge.html"
          title="FontForge-20230101">FontForge-20230101</a>, but often
          commercial tools), the source will provide no benefit, so do not
          install it. One or two fonts even ship with Web Open Font Format
          (WOFF) files - this is useful if you run a webserver and want to
          use that font on your website, but not useful for a desktop system.
        </p>
        <p>
          To provide greater Unicode coverage, you should install some of the
          following fonts, depending on what websites and languages you want
          to read. The next part of this page details some fonts which cover
          at least Latin alphabets, and the final part deals with some CJK

          The <a class="ulink" href=
          "https://corefonts.sourceforge.net/">Microsoft Core Fonts</a> date
          from 2002. They were supplied with old versions of Microsoft
          Windows and were apparently made available for general use. You can
          extract them from the '.exe' files using <span class=
          "application">bsd-tar</span> from <a class="xref" href=
          "../general/libarchive.html" title=
          "libarchive-3.7.2">libarchive-3.7.2</a>. Make sure that you read
          the license before using them. At one time some of these fonts
          (particularly Arial, Times New Roman, and to a lesser extent
          Courier New) were widely used on web pages. The full set contains
          Andale Mono, Arial, Arial Black, Comic Sans MS, Courier New,
          Georgia, Impact, Times New Roman, Trebuchet MS, Verdana and
          Webdings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please note that if you only want to use a font with the same
          metrics (character size, etc) as Arial, Courier New, or Times New
          Roman you can use the libre Liberation Fonts (above), and similarly
          you can replace Georgia with Gelasio.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although many old posts recommend installing these fonts for output
          which looks better, less old posts say that these are 'ugly' or
          'broken' with modern <span class="application">Fontconfig</span>,
          <span class="application">Freetype</span> and <span class=
          "application">Pango.</span> Most people will not want to install
          any of these fonts.
        </p>
        <p>
          The newer fonts which Microsoft made their defaults in later
          releases of MS Windows or MS Office (Calibri and Cambria) have
          never been freely available. However, if you do not have them
          installed you can find metric equivalents (Carlito and Caladea)
          above.

          The <a class="ulink" href="https://fonts.google.com/noto/">Noto
          fonts</a> ('No Tofu', i.e. avoiding boxes with dots [hex digits]
          when a glyph cannot be found) are a set of fonts which aim to cover
          <span class="emphasis"><em>every glyph in Unicode, no matter how
          obscure</em></span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          People using languages written in Latin, Greek or Cyrillic
          alphabets only need to install Noto Sans, Noto Serif and/or Noto
          Sans Mono. For more details on the organization of Noto fonts see

          "https://fonts.google.com/noto/use#how-are-noto-fonts-organized/">how
          are noto fonts organized</a>. There are also separate fonts for
          every other current writing system, but those do not cover text in
          Latin languages.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those three fonts are the first-choice preferences of <span class=
          "application">Fontconfig</span> for text in those three alphabets,
          and they are updated frequently to cover recent Unicode additions
          such as the extensions for phonetic transcription in Latin and
          Cyrillic alphabets.
        </p>
        <p>
          It may be easier to download a specific Noto font by going to
          <a class="ulink" href=
          "https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Noto+Sans">Noto Sans</a> and
          changing the font name as appropriate, with '+' between each word,
          e.g. 'Noto+Kufi+Arabic', 'Noto+Serif+Georgian' or whatever, then
          clicking on 'Download family'.

          For the Noto CJK fonts it is easier to find the specific zip

          and look for the newest Sans or Serif version with its own updated
          Download guide and its assets. The Download guides should help you
          to identify which zip file best matches your requirements.

          Noto Sans is the preferred font for KDE Plasma and applications,
          except for monospace fonts where <a class="ulink" href=
          "https://github.com/source-foundry/Hack">Hack</a> is preferred.
        </p>
        <p>
          For writing systems not using the Latin, Greek or Cyrillic
          alphabets the Noto fonts are not preferred by <span class=
          "application">Fontconfig</span>. If you use a Noto font for a
          modern language where another installed font also covers it (e.g.
          the DejaVu fonts cover several Right-to-Left alphabets), you might
          need to set a preference for <span class=
          "application">Fontconfig</span> - see the previous page.

          For Indic languages, <span class="application">Fontconfig</span>
          now prefers Lohit fonts (Sanskrit for 'red'). They can be found at

        <p>
          As indicated earlier, usage of a combination of Chinese, Japanese
          and Korean characters can be tricky - each font only covers a
          subset of the available codepoints, the preferred shapes of the
          glyphs can differ between the languages, and many of the CJK fonts
          do not actually support modern Korean.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, <span class="application">Fontconfig</span> prefers Chinese
          to Japanese by default. Tuning that is covered at <a class="xref"
          href="tuning-fontconfig.html#prefer-chosen-CJK-fonts" title=
          "Prefer chosen CJK fonts">Preferring chosen CJK fonts</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although Unicode has been extended to allow a very large number of
          CJK codepoints, those outside the Base Plane (greater than
          U+0xFFFF) are not commonly used in Mandarin (the normal form of
          written Chinese, whether Simplified (Mainland China, Malaysia, and
          Singapore) or Traditional (Hong Kong and Taiwan)), or Japanese.
        </p>
        <p>
          For Hong Kong, which uses Traditional Chinese and where Cantonese
          is the dominant language, the Hong Kong Supplementary Character Set
          was added to Unicode in 2005 and revised in 2009 (it is part of CJK
          Extension B and contains more than 1900 characters). Earlier fonts
          will not be able to support either Cantonese or use these
          characters where local names are written in Mandarin. The UMing HK,
          Noto Sans HK and WenQuanYi Zen Hei fonts all seem to cover Hong
          Kong usage (<span class="application">Fontconfig</span> disagrees
          about Noto Sans HK).
        </p>
        <p>
          The Han glyphs are double width, and other glyphs in the same font
          may be narrower. For their CJK content, all of these fonts can be
          regarded as monospaced (i.e. fixed width).
        </p>
        <p>
          If you wish to use Noto fonts, there are also Serif versions of
          their various CJK fonts. The Noto Sans/Serif SC/TC/HK/JP/KR fonts
          are derived from a monolithic <a class="ulink" href=
          "https://github.com/notofonts/noto-cjk">noto-cjk</a> repository and
          you can find the <code class="filename">.ttc</code> files for the
          entire Noto Sans CJK (including SC/TC/HK/JP/KR) or Noto Serif CJK
          font family there. Google recommends the normal users to use the
          separate Noto Sans/Serif SC/TC/HK/JP/KR fonts instead, but if you
          are capable and willing to read texts in more than one CJK
          character systems it may be easier to use a monolithic <code class=
          "filename">.ttc</code> file for full coverage.
        </p>
        <p>
          If all you wish to do is render CJK glyphs, installing <a class=

          In Chinese, there are three font styles in common use: Sung (also
          known as Song or Ming), which is the most-common ornamented
          ("serif") form, Kai ("brush strokes") which is an earlier
          ornamented style that looks quite different, and modern Hei
          ("sans"). Unless you appreciate the differences, you probably do
          not want to install Kai fonts.
